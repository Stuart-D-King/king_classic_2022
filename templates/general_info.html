      <h4>Rules & Format</h4>
			<div class="boxed">
				<p>The stroke play component of the King Classic <b>will only be four rounds</b> - the morning rounds on Days 1 and 2, and both rounds on Day 3. You must play these exact four rounds to be eligible to win the King Classic and have your name on the trophy. The winner will have the lowest <b>net score</b> over the four rounds.</p>
	      <p>The highest score you can card is +7 on a hole. Putt everything out and play everything down. All standard rules apply, including the local rule that allows you to drop and take a two-stroke penalty anywhere perpendicular to where a ball is lost or crossed the out of bounds line. Check out <b><a href="https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-modernization/major-changes/golfs-new-rules-stroke-and-distance.html" target="_blank">this video</a></b> for a more thorough explanation of the rule.</p>
				<p>Initial handicaps must be verified, but do not need to be official. If you do not have a GHIN, there are several free apps that will calculate a handicap for you. <b><a href="https://www.thegrint.com/" target="_blank">The Grint</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.swingbyswing.com/" target="_blank">Swing by Swing</a></b> are a few good ones.</p>
				<p>Handicaps will <b>not</b> be adjusted based on performance during the trip. Rather, a course handicap is calculated for each round based on your initial index and the course rating and slope of the tees you elect to play. A course handicap is calculated as (H.I. x (slope / 113)) + (course rating - course par), rounded to the nearest integer. For example, if your index is 8.2 and you play from the Tournament tees on The Oconee course (6,511 yards, 71.4 rating, 134 slope) your course handicap would be (8.2 x (134 / 113)) + (71.4 - 72) = 9.124 = 9. However, if you decided to play the Three/Four tees on The Oconee (5,862 yards, 68.8 rating, 126 slope) your course handicap would be (8.2 x (126 / 113)) + (68.8 - 72) = 5.943 = 6. Each player will select the tees they wish to play from for each course prior to the trip. <b>Mid-trip changes to your selected tees are not allowed</b>. Anyone under 50 cannot play a tee less than 5,800 yards, and anyone over 50 cannot play a tee less than 5,300 yards.</p>
				<p>Please review each course scorecard and select the tees you wish to play. Send <b><a href="mailto: sdking49@gmail.com">Stuart</a></b> your selected tees by October 7th.</p>

	      <p><b>Skins</b> are based on net low score, and are $5 per round and then split among the participants based on the number of skins won. Please note that if your handicap is greater than 18, for the skins game (and only for the skins game) your handicap will be adjusted to 18. <b>Closest to the pin</b> is $2.50 per round, and the hole has been pre-selected and identified above.</p>
	      <p>Alex is the bank, so settle up with him. The total for skins and closest to the pin for 6 rounds is $45 ($5 x 6 = $30; $2.50 x 6 = $15; $30 + $15 = $45). If you don't already have it, download and install <b><a href="https://venmo.com/" target="_blank">Venmo</a></b> on your phone to make money exchange quick and easy. If you don't use Venmo, please bring cash and pay Alex before play begins. He will settle up with you in the same manner that you use to buy in (i.e. Venmo or cash).

				<p>Each round an individual player will put in $10 ($60 total for the trip). At the <b>end</b> of each round, the 12 players will be split into teams of two. The top three two-man teams with the lowest <b>net</b> combined score will win the cash prizes accordingly:</p>
	      <p>First place: $60</p>
	      <p>Second place: $40</p>
	      <p>Third place: $20</p>
				<p>Ties will result in the splitting of the relevant prizes. For example, a two-way tie for first will see those two teams each winning $50 ($60 + $40 = $100 / 2 = $50), with the third place team winning $20.</p>
